      'This is the most iconic work by Tarsília do Amaral, a Brazilian artist known as one of the main precursors of Brazilian Modernism. Abaporu, Tupi-Guarani name of origin and meaning "man who eats people", was the initial milestone of the Anthropophagic Movement, which consisted in the swallowing of foreign culture that came to Brazil, adapting it to the reality of the country. Tarsilia painted Abaporu as a birthday present for her husband at the time, writer Oswald de Andrade. Currently, this painting is the most valued Brazilian canvas in the world art market. Abaporu is exhibited at the Museum of Latin American Art of Buenos Aires (MALBA) in the Argentine capital.',

During this period, Velázquez represented scenes from everyday life. In the case of this work, we see the young infanta Margarida Teresa of Habsburg surrounded by her small court of ladies and servants. This famous painting is considered one of the most analyzed in the world, mainly because of its complexity and enigmatic composition. The Girls is currently on display at the Prado Museum in Madrid.",

      'One of the works that helped immortalize Michelangelo as one of the most important artists of all time! The Last Judgment is a huge fresco that occupies the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. Inspired by the biblical narration, the artist reproduces images that represent the moment of the resurrection of the dead and Divine Justice. This fresco was made after the extensive set of paintings Michelangelo had already made on the ceiling of the Chapel (1508 - 1512), representing nine scenes from Genesis (creation of the world). The Creation of Adam, however, is considered one of the most famous. Both works of the Italian painter are considered landmarks of Renaissance painting and one of the most iconic in the history of art.',
